  // * Starting from the previous button ("1"), you move right twice (to "3") and then down three times (stopping at
  // "9" after two moves and ignoring the third), ending up with 9.
  // * Continuing from "9", you move left, up, right, down, and left, ending with 8.
  // * Finally, you move up four times (stopping at "2"), then down once, ending with 5.
